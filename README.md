## **1. Data Preprocessing**

### Data Import and Initial Exploration

- **Importing Dataset:**
    - The dataset is imported from a CSV file for initial exploration and analysis.

- **Initial Data Exploration:**
    - Checking the structure and basic statistics of the dataset.
    - Setting the 'ID' column as the index for better data management.

### Data Cleaning

- **Handling Outliers:**
    - Initial analysis shows high variance in key metrics such as TML, CVCM, WVR, and Space Code.
    - Filtering outliers using quantile-based methods.
    - Visualizing the distribution of filtered data using histograms and box plots.

- **Further Outlier Removal:**
    - Using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to further clean the data by removing extreme outliers.
    - Rechecking the distribution and presence of outliers through updated histograms and box plots.

### Handling Missing Values

- **Identifying Missing Values:**
    - Analyzing the dataset for missing values.
    - Dropping columns and rows with significant missing data, particularly in 'Cure', 'Material Usage', and 'Space Code'.

- **Final Data Cleaning:**
    - Checking and removing any duplicate records.
    - Ensuring the final dataset is clean and ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

### Final Dataset Preparation

- **Saving Cleaned Data:**
    - The final cleaned dataset is saved as a CSV file for further analysis in the next stages.

## **1. Define Goals**

### Objective

1. Develop a `linear regression model` to evaluate and predict material performance based on material quality metrics (TML, CVCM, WVR).
2. Use `classification machine learning` to assess material reliability by predicting values for procurement and quality control.

### Understanding Features

- **CVCM:** Measures the percentage of volatile material that can condense on a cold surface during the outgassing test. Lower CVCM values are preferable for high-vacuum environments.
- **WVR:** Measures the amount of water vapor a material absorbs back after being subjected to tests. Lower WVR values are preferable to avoid issues like corrosion or degradation.
- **TML:** Measures the percentage of a material's mass lost during a test. Lower TML indicates better performance in vacuum environments.

## **2. Feature Engineering**

- **Supplier Performance Evaluation:**
    - Calculating performance scores based on TML, CVCM, and WVR.
    - Adding noise to the dataset to simulate realistic scenarios.

## **3. Initial Model Selection and Implementation**

### Regression Models

- **Linear Regression:** Predicting the supplier performance score.
- **Random Forest Regressor:** An alternative regression model for predicting performance.

### Classification Models

- **Logistic Regression:** Classifying suppliers into performance categories.
- **Random Forest Classifier:** A model for classifying performance.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Another classification model considered.

## **4. Best Model Selection**

- **Regression Model:** Linear Regression is selected based on evaluation scores.
- **Classification Model:** Logistic Regression is chosen for classification tasks.

## **5. Conclusion**

- **Further Research Recommendations:**
    - Expand the dataset to improve model performance.
    - Experiment with additional classification models.
    - Incorporate categorical features for deeper analysis.

- **Potential Application of the Model:**
    - Optimized material selection for specific space applications.
    - Proactive quality control to prevent mission failures.
    - Driving R&D efforts to improve material performance.
